\chapter{EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH}

\section{Experimental Objective}

\section{Experimental Facility}
Baseline acoustic measurements without plasma flow control were obtained in the Notre Dame Anechoic Wind Tunnel Facility (ND AWT). The ND AWT is a low-noise, open-jet acoustic wind tunnel with a free jet test section measuring 24-in-(0.610 m)-high by 24-in-(0.610 m)-wide installed in a large anechoic chamber suitable for frequencies above 100 Hz. The maximum empty test section velocity is approximately $U_\infty = 35$ m/s. The maximum safe tunnel velocity with the Notre Dame G550 Nose Landing Gear 30\%-scale model (ND G550) installed is  30 m/s corresponding to a Mach number of $M_\infty=0.1$.

Atmospheric properties such as ambient temperature and pressure were acquired using a digital thermometer and barometer. The tunnel speed is measured using a pitot-static probe installed approximately 6 in (0.154 m) from the free jet inlet centerline. From these data local sonic speed and the flow Mach number is computed.

\section{Notre Dame G550 Nose Landing Gear Model}
Acoustic measurement for two baseline landing gear model configurations were performed. The first, designated Baseline 1, consisted of the ND G550 model without the plasma fairing installed, which is shown in the photograph of Figure \ref{fig:mod1a}. The second, designated Baseline 2, involved the ND G550 model retrofitted with a plasma fairing assembly in order to facilitate installation of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators for flow control. This configuration is shown in the photograph of Figure \ref{fig:mod1b}. None of the acoustic measurements presented in this report for both configurations involved the use of plasma flow control. Rather, the focus was on the characterization of baseline acoustics for both configurations.

\section{Microphone Measurements}
A polar array of omnidirectional microphones was used to acquire far field noise level spectra along the length of the AWT test section. It consists of a 1/2-in ACO Model 7046 electret microphone with companion 4012 preamplifier and PS9200 power supply. A schematic illustrating the array is shown in Figure \ref{fig:array}. Additionally, the array configuration relative to the G550 model is shown in the photograph of Figure \ref{fig:arraypic}. The microphone is mounted using a microphone stand so as to protrude from an acoustically treated rail by approximately 13 in (0.330 m). The total range of acoustic source-to-microphone angle spanned by the polar array is approximately $30^\circ \leq \theta \leq 150^\circ$ as referenced from the upper torque arm of the model in the downstream flow direction. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:arraypic}, the polar array is situated along the length of the free jet test section and positioned at the same height as the upper torque arm of the model, with the plane of the microphone located approximately 59 in (1.50 m) from the test section centerline.

\section{Data Acquisition}
For microphone data acquisition, a National Instruments USB-6343 DAQ was used, yielding a total of 45 available channels with 48-bit ADC. The sampling parameters for the microphone data acquisition are listed in Table \ref{tab:data}.

\section{Current Results}

\subsection{Wind Tunnel Background Noise Characterization}
It was deemed important to establish that the background noise levels in the ND AWT were sufficiently below that of the ND G550 model. To that end, measurement of noise levels for both Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 G550 configurations were compared with those obtained with the AWT tunnel runnign empty. Figure \ref{fig:empty} presents a representative comparison of 1/3-octave band sound pressure level (SPL) spectra obtained for the Baseline 1 configurations and the empty tunnel. The figure clearly shows that the background empty tunnel noise level is several orders of magnitude below that of the ND G550, so that the effects of plasma flow control on noise production will be detectable in this facility.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Far field check}
This section describes a procedure for verifying the far field assumption for microphone measurements.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Effects of Tripping}
Previous work on the NASA G550 Nose Landing Gear (NASA G550) involved application of serrated transition strips that were applied along the length of the shock strut in order to create a turbulent boundary layer prior to separation. For consistency with this previous work, the influence of similar aerodynamic trips was explored on the ND G550 Baseline 1 model. A distributed roughness element made of standard diving board tape was fixed to the shock strut. Sample results comparing 1/3-octave band SPL spectra for the tripped and untripped cases are presented in Figure \ref{fig:trip}. This figure shows that there was very little influence of the trip on radiated noise. Since a trip would restrict the optimum placement of the plasma actuators, it was omitted from the model and the acoustic results that follow were obtained without tripping unless otherwise indicated.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison with University of Florida Anechoic Flow Facility Measurements}
To match the numerical simulations being performed concurrently in this study, the far field microphone distance $d$, was 72 in (1.83 m) array-to-model and 59 in (1.50 m) microphone-to-model. However, previous studies conducted at the University of Florida Anechoic Flow Facility (UFAFF) on the NASA G550 model were performed at a source-to-microphone distance of 48 in. In order to form a basis for comparison with acoustic results from that study, 1/3-octave band SPL spectra were obtained with the ND Baseline 1 model in the ND AWT for a source-to-microphone distance of 48 in (1.22 m). Even after accounting for the source-to-microphone distance disparity, the UFAFF experiments were performed at a freestream Mach number $M_\infty =$ 0.189 and the Notre Dame experiments were performed at $M_\infty=$ 0.1. The effect of disparate Mach numbers on the SPL can be accounted for by scaling the Notre Dame results via the relation, 

\begin{equation}
SPL_2 = SPL_1 - 10 \log \left( \frac{M_1}{M_2} \right)^6,
\end{equation}

where $SPL_1$ and $M_1$ denote the ND AWT experimental values, $M_2$ denotes the UFAFF test Mach number (0.189) and $SPL_2$ represents the ND AWT sound pressure level values corrected for Mach number. Figure \ref{fig:farfield} compares 1/3-octave band SPL spectra obtained in both facilities for the case of $\theta = 90^\circ$. In this plot the frequency is expressed in terms of Strouhal number, $St_D = f D / U_\infty$, where length scale $D$ is the shock strut diameter upstream of the torque arm and $U_\infty$ is the freestream velocity.
There is good collapse of the NASA G550 and ND G550 data from $0.3 \leq St_D \leq 0.6$. Below this range there is about 4-5 dB difference before the 100 Hz AWT cutoff frequency. Above this range there is significant discrepancy. The NASA G550 model is characterized by a peak near $St_D=$ 3 and spectral roll-off above this peak. The ND G550 model lacks this high frequency content. The components of the ND G550 model are mostly fabricated from SLA plastic, while the NASA G550 consists of mostly aluminum and carbon fiber. To compensate for the differences in tensile strength, thickness was added to several components of the ND G550 model as shown in the CAD images in Figure \ref{fig:cad}. Additionally, it was necessary to construct most of the ND G550 model from plastic to facilitate the retrofitting of plasma actuators. It is possible, but by no means certain that these design modifications may play a roll in the observed differences in noise spectra.

\subsection{Baseline Sound Magnitude and Directivity}
The Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL) is calculated by integrating the power spectral density from $100 \leq f \leq 12,500$ Hz. OASPL at each location of the polar array, $30^\circ \leq \theta \leq 150^\circ$, is given in Figure \ref{fig:polar}. Baseline far field 1/3-octave band spectra are reported for each location on the polar array in Figure \ref{fig:octave}.
There is consistent noise reduction of about 6 dB observed at each microphone location from $100 \leq f \leq 200$ Hz. Additionally, the twin peaks at $300$ Hz and $500$ Hz respectively show up as on peak at $300$ Hz for the $\theta = 30^\circ$ location. These spectral peaks increase in magnitude with increasing $\theta$, for $\theta \leq 90^\circ$, and decrease in magnitude for $90^\circ < \theta \leq 150^\circ$. Similar observations were made in unsteady pressure during the Phase I study on the ND torque arm model, suggesting that these peaks are characteristic of the torque arm section of the ND G550 model. However, this will need to be substantiated with unsteady pressure data on the ND G550, which will be included in the next report. Finally, the shape of the partial directivity plot exhibits dipole-like behavior.

%In preparation for reading this dissertation, I would highly recommend
%reading some of the other material available on
%Gnus~\citep{gnus98:_gerry_ganst,greenfield96:_gettin_know_gnu}.  They
%are very well written and will give you a fuller understanding of
%Gnus.
%
%Gnus are frequently mistakes for squirrels.  They are not squirrels.
%They are Gnus.  Don't call them squirrels, either (unless you have
%food in your hand); they tend to get a bit upset.\footnote{This is
%  frequently mistaken for the chattering and scampering away.  Gnus
%  are actually quite polite; they will leave if they have nothing nice
%  to say, for fear of saying something offensive.}  If you have food
%in your hand, they tend to ignore this insult and accept your food as
%a peace offering.\footnote{Sometimes they'll follow you if you continue
%to refuse to feed them.}

%Table~\ref{tbl:bogus1} shows some feeding frequencies for where Gnus
%like to eat around the Notre Dame campus.  Gnus have work weeks, just
%like humans do, hence the much lower frequencies on weekends.  This
%can lead us to conclude that Gnu weekend shifts are much smaller than
%the normal work-week shifts.  In fact, we can attempt to parametrize the
%sighting frequency, $\mathcal{F}$, by the student population, type of food, and
%day of the week as:
%\begin{equation}
%  \mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}(p,f,d).
%\end{equation}
%Table~\ref{tbl:bogus2} shows what they
%typically like to eat.

%Gnus typically tend to come out when there are large gatherings of
%humans with food.  Gnus work very hard at providing us with all the
%things that we like (trees, dirt, air, etc.), and so we should freely
%give them food.  They will come up and stand a respectful distance
%away from you, waiting to see if they will be rewarded for their
%efforts.  If you offer some food, they will take it and back off a
%respectful distance in order to consume their food while leaving you
%to your ``personal space.''  

%\section{Groovin' Gnus}
%\label{sec:groovin-gnus}
%
%Gnus do tend to stay away from humans in their normal day-to-day
%workings.  This is mainly because humans don't, for the most part,
%understand what they are doing.  If a Gnu is working, and a human
%approaches it, the Gnu will tend to drop whatever it is doing and run
%away.  This is probably do to the tendency for humans to have ``group
%meetings'' and ``productivity seminars.''  Most Gnus are deathly
%afraid of such overmanagement, and run at the slightest hint of it,
%for fear that it will cripple their real work.
%
%It is interesting, however, that Gnus have chosen an Institution of
%Higher Education for their BOO.\footnote{Base of Operations.}  It is
%often said that:
%\begin{quote}
%  Academic politics are the dirtiest, meanest, ugliest, and generally
%  the most low-down, in-your-face, and kick-em-while-they're-down than
%  anywhere else (even Washington D.C.)  because the stakes are so low.
%\end{quote}
%It has been hypothesized that the Gnus are subtly trying to affect a
%change for the better (i.e., eliminating the overmanagement problems)
%by working the very system that they are trying to change, from
%within.  That is, the graduates from Notre Dame can learn from the
%examples of the Gnus here, and run screaming (or chattering) at the
%slightest hint of overmanagement, and let the real work proceed
%unhindered.
