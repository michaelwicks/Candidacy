\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
Airframe noise is significant

Landing gear is primary source of airframe noise

Health risks

\section{Motivation}
The present work is motivated to reduce noise by flow control via application of DBD plasma actuator technology.

In this chapter, the physics of airframe noise production is discussed. The structure of Aircraft landing gear is presented. This geometry is grouped into two main sub-systems which can be considered for flow-control separately. Areas of noise contribution are considered and the underlying physical mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the literature is reviewed with respect to the application of Plasma Flow Control to increasingly complex geometries.

\section{Theory of Aeroacoustics}
The modern theory of aeroacoustics, that is sound generated by aerodynamic means, is based on James Lighthill's so-called acoustic analogy. He states that sound generated in a fluid flow is only important in regions of turbulent fluctuations \cite{howe2003}. Based on this assumption, the Navier-Stokes Equation and isentropic equation of state are

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1-1}
	\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(\rho u_i)}{\partial x_i} = 0
\end{equation}

	\begin{equation} \label{eq:1-2}
		\frac{\partial (\rho u_i)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(\rho u_i u_j + P_{ij})}{\partial x_j} = 0
	\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	c_o^2 = \frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}|_{s=const.} = \frac{p'}{\rho'}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial t^2} - c_o^2 \nabla^2 \rho = \frac{\partial^2 T_{ij}}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T_{ij} = \rho u_i u_j + P_{ij} - c_o^2(\rho - \rho_0) \delta_{ij},
\end{equation}

where
\begin{equation}
\delta_{ij} = \left\{
\begin{array}{lcr}
1 & \mbox{if} & i = j \\
0 & \mbox{if} & i \neq j
\end{array}
\right\}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T_{ij} \approx \rho_0 u_i u_j.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
p' = c_o^2 \rho' = \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \int_{V} \frac{T_{ij}}{r}dV,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\int_{V} dV \propto D^3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T_{ij} \propto \rho_o U_o^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial}{c_o \partial t} \propto \frac{f}{c_o} \propto \frac{U_o}{c_o D}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
p' \propto \left( \frac{U_o}{c_o D} \right)^2 \left( D^3 \right) \left( \frac{\rho_o U_o^2}{r} \right) \propto \frac{U_o^4}{r}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
W \propto p'^2 \propto \frac{U_o^8}{r^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
p' &= \underbrace{ \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \int_V \left[ \frac{T_{ij}}{r} \right] dV }_I - \underbrace{ \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \int_S \left[ \frac{P_{ij} + \rho v_i v_j}{r} \right] n_i dS }_{II} \\
&+ \underbrace{ \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_S \left[ \frac{\rho v_i}{r} \right] n_i dS}_{III},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
II : \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \int_S \left[ \frac{P_{ij} + \rho v_i v_j}{r} \right] n_i dS \propto \left( \frac{U_o}{c_oD} \right) \left( \frac{\rho_o U_o^2}{r} \right) \left( D^2 \right) \propto \frac{U_o^3}{r}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
III : \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_S \left[ \frac{\rho v_i}{r} \right] n_i dS \propto \left( \frac{U_o}{D} \right) \left( \frac{\rho_o U_o}{r} \right) \left( D^2 \right) \propto \frac{U_o^2}{r}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
II : W \propto p'^2 \propto \frac{U_o^6}{r^2},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
III : W \propto p'^2 \propto \frac{U_o^4}{r^2}.
\end{equation}

%Table~\ref{tbl:bogus1} shows some feeding frequencies for where Gnus
%like to eat around the Notre Dame campus.  Gnus have work weeks, just
%like humans do, hence the much lower frequencies on weekends.  This
%can lead us to conclude that Gnu weekend shifts are much smaller than
%the normal work-week shifts.  In fact, we can attempt to parametrize the
%sighting frequency, $\mathcal{F}$, by the student population, type of food, and
%day of the week as:
%\begin{equation}
%  \mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}(p,f,d).
%\end{equation}

%Gnus typically tend to come out when there are large gatherings of
%humans with food.  Gnus work very hard at providing us with all the
%things that we like (trees, dirt, air, etc.), and so we should freely
%give them food.  They will come up and stand a respectful distance
%away from you, waiting to see if they will be rewarded for their
%efforts.  If you offer some food, they will take it and back off a
%respectful distance in order to consume their food while leaving you
%to your ``personal space.''

%\section{Groovin' Gnus}
%\label{sec:groovin-gnus}
%
%Gnus do tend to stay away from humans in their normal day-to-day
%workings.  This is mainly because humans don't, for the most part,
%understand what they are doing.  If a Gnu is working, and a human
%approaches it, the Gnu will tend to drop whatever it is doing and run
%away.  This is probably do to the tendency for humans to have ``group
%meetings'' and ``productivity seminars.''  Most Gnus are deathly
%afraid of such overmanagement, and run at the slightest hint of it,
%for fear that it will cripple their real work.
%
%It is interesting, however, that Gnus have chosen an Institution of
%Higher Education for their BOO.\footnote{Base of Operations.}  It is
%often said that:
%\begin{quote}
%  Academic politics are the dirtiest, meanest, ugliest, and generally
%  the most low-down, in-your-face, and kick-em-while-they're-down than
%  anywhere else (even Washington D.C.)  because the stakes are so low.
%\end{quote}
%It has been hypothesized that the Gnus are subtly trying to affect a
%change for the better (i.e., eliminating the overmanagement problems)
%by working the very system that they are trying to change, from
%within.  That is, the graduates from Notre Dame can learn from the
%examples of the Gnus here, and run screaming (or chattering) at the
%slightest hint of overmanagement, and let the real work proceed
%unhindered.
