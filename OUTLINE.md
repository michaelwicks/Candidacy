#Candidacy Outline

##Chapter 1: Introduction
**1.1 Motivation**

**1.2 Theory of Aeroacoustics**

Lighthill analogy (acoustic radiation)

volume only

acoustic power = quadrupole source w/ no flow
turbulence generates quadrupole source (turbulent jet). Turbulence emits quadrupole sources in random orientations


 w/ solid boundary

acoustic power = dipole source w/ no flow
acoustic power = monopole source w/ no flow

Note: quadrupole is more 'efficient' acoustic source but due to directivity (lobes) acoustic waves do not propogate well to the observer compared to dipole and monopole sources

**1.3 landing gear**

**1.3.1 geometry**

**1.3.2 Noise sources**

acoustic compactness
low frequency = large geometries (wheel / door)
mid frequency = main struts / linkages
KL << 1 (acoustically compact)-> distribution of dipoles

high frequency = small details (sharp edges / hoses / electrical wiring)
KL >= 1 (acoustically noncompact)->
* mutual cancellation of acoustic radiation
* degradation of radiation efficiency (dipole to quadrupole).
Note: degradation of radiation efficiency from dipole to quadrupole corresponds to increase in acoustic power W. (U^6/r^2 -> U^8/r^2)

Very complex problem: show sources of noise on LG model

Two strategies for noise reduction:

1. reduce OASPL (acoustic power)
2. redirect acoustic waves from flyover orientation to sideline so they do not reach observer.

##Chapter 2: Literature Review

**2.1 Aerodynamics + aeroacoustics**

**2.1.1 single cylinder (2-D)**

**2.1.2 tandem cylinder (2-D)**

**2.1.3 torque arm (3-D)**

**2.1.4 landing gear (3-D)**

wake-body interactions of closely-spaced components important airframe noise contributors

Note: as drag force increases, vortex shedding frequency decreases. flat plate Cd > cylinder Cd = flat plate Std < cylinder Std

**2.2 Noise Reduction**

Note: argue that plasma flow control is a viable method for noise reduction.
For example NASA toboggan truck fairing (add-on fairings) caused adverse effects = noise increase due to flow displacement increasing local velocity and thus noise from adjacent gear components.

Low-noise gear design through almost complete elimination of structure details provides lower noise levels in mid/high-frequency range, whereas low-frequency levels occasionally tend to increase and radiation directivity approaches omnidirectional characteristics.
